## Project Description

The **Degree App** is a simple Dart-based command-line application that generates a random degree score between 0 and 100 and assigns a corresponding grade based on predefined grading criteria. The app helps demonstrate conditional statements and random number generation in Dart. The grading system categorizes scores into different letter grades (A, B, C, D, E, and Fail) with further distinctions such as `+` and `-` to indicate performance within each grade range.

In the future, we plan to implement different control statements such as the `switch` statement to enhance the grading logic and improve code readability.

## Control Statements Used in the App

### **1. Conditional Statements (Decision Making)**
   - **if statement**
   - **if-else statement**
   - **if-else if-else ladder**
   - **switch statement** (planned for future implementation)

### **2. Looping Statements (Iteration)**
   - **for loop**
   - **while loop**
   - **do-while loop**
   - **forEach loop** (used with collections)

### **3. Jump Statements (Control Transfer)**
   - **break statement** (exits a loop or switch case)
   - **continue statement** (skips an iteration of a loop)
   - **return statement** (exits a function and returns a value)
